pktgen - A declarative packet generator
=======================================

``pktgen`` is a packet generator which allows creating streams of network
packets using a declarative approach. Packet wrangling is done using Scapy_,
making it possible to easily generate almost any kind of packet supported by
it.

Features
--------

* Support most of the packet types supported by Scapy_.
* Additional `elements <available elements_>`__ which allow defining
  complex package sets. 
* Define contents of packet flows in a declarative way (see
  `spec file syntax`_ below for an glimpse of the syntax).
* Output of packet streams to ``pcap`` dump files, the same format used by
  ``tcpdump`` and supprted by many network tools which use ``libpcap``.


Local dependencies
------------------

The ``pktgen-localdeps`` script can be used to run ``pktgen`` with the
dependencies installed in a local virtualenv_, which will be created in the
``.env`` subdirectory automatically. The script forwards the arguments to
``pktgen``.

It is possible to specify which Python interpreter to use by defining the
``PYTHON`` environment variable::

    PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python2.7 ./pktgen-localdeps [...]


Spec file syntax
----------------

Packet generation spec files are written in the HiPack_ format, like in the
following example::

    # Comments span to the end of lines
    ip {
        .src "1.2.3.4"
        .dst "5.6.7.8"
        tcp {
            .flags = ""
            randbytes {
                .size 50
            }
        }
    }

Items are interpreted in the following way:

* Blocks (HiPack dictionaries) describe an element.
* Keys starting with a period (e.g. ``.flags``) are attributes of the
  element.
* A key without a leading period (e.g. ``tcp``) names the kind of the
  child element.
* A number of elements map to their Scapy_ `equivalents <Scapy elements_>`__,
  and support all the attributes accepted their Scapy counterparts.


Available elements
------------------

``raw``
~~~~~~~
Generates payload for packets with fixed ``data``. The strings used to
specify the data may contain hex escapes, allowing to include any binary
data.

Example::

    raw {
        .data "Unicode networked computers icon: \01\F5\A7 (U+1F5A7)"
    }

Packets with no payload can be created by using an empty string::

    raw { .data "" }


``randbytes``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generates a payload of random bytes, of a given ``size``. Optionally it is
possible to specify a ``deviation``, which makes the size to be taken as an
average sample of a Gaussian distribution with the given deviation.

Example::

    randbytes {
        .size 50
        .deviation 10
    }


``pdist``
~~~~~~~~~
Picks from several choices which have an associated probability of being
chosen.

Example::

    pdist [
        { .probability 0.33, raw { .data "A" } }
        { .probability 0.66, raw { .data "B" } }
    ]
